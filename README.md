# vCircTrappist
This program allows you to perform circRNA alignments on viral genomes (mono- or multi- segments). The whole script might take from 15 minutes to 3 days to run completely depending on the amount of data to process. In most cases, the results should be available within an hour.  The python-based scripts were used in Chasseur et al, 2024.
